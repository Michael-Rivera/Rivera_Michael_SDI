/*
You are fishing on Gold Metal Waters. You want to bring your wife home fish for dinner but there are certain regulations
to follow. For trout the maximum length you can keep is 22 inches and the minimum is 15 inches. There is a limit of two trout.
 There is also Smallmouth Bass in that stretch of the river. The max and min lengths are 18 and 15 respectively with a take home limit of
 four. You are fishing with inline spinners. Trout will bite if it is cloudy and bass will bite if it is sunny. What
is the weather like and what fish will your wife be having for Dinner? She would prefer trout.
