var slices = 8; // Number of slices per pizza.

var people = 19; // Number of people at the party.

var pizzas = 7; // number of pizzas ordered.

var numSlices = slices * pizzas; // Total number of slices between all pizzas.

var slicesPer = numSlices / people; // Amount of slices each person can have.

console.log ("Each person ate " + slicesPer + " slices at the party.");
// This prints out "Each person ate x slices at the party."
