// Michael Rivera Expressions Worksheet
// How old is Sparky in Dog Years based on his actual age?

//var sparkysAge =4;  // Sparkys age in human years
//var dogYears =7;  // Sparkys age in dog years
//var result = sparkysAge * 7 ; // The result is Sparkys age in human years times dog years

//console.log ("Sparky is "+ sparkysAge + " human years old which is " + result + " in dog years.");
// To get the console to print the desired result I had to add strings around the variables in the console log.

// I commented out the previous problem so that it wouldn't interfere with the next problem

// Slice of Pie part 1

// How many slices can each person have?

var slices = 8;

var people = 19;

var pizzas = 5;


var numSlices = slices * pizzas;

print.log (numSlices);
